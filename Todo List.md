# Todo List

# Urgent

# Future Work
* Add open, new and save-as options. At first, creating new files or opening others will populate a single editor tab, but in the future dynamic tabs should be implmented. If using only a single tab, ask user if they want to save unsaved changes before switching. In the future, a feature to indicate unsaved changes should be implemented.
*  Do general clean-up and finish writing the README.
* Check different STL viewers to see how they orient their coordinate systems.

# Complete
* Fixed bug in the export process that crash program at the beginning of the cms algorithm. I think it is a thread race condition related to printing out the triangle counts for each level.
