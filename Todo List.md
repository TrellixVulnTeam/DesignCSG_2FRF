# Todo List
1. Add open, new and save-as options. At first, creating new files or opening others will populate a single editor tab, but in the future dynamic tabs should be implmented. If using only a single tab, ask user if they want to save unsaved changes before switching. In the future, a feature to indicate unsaved changes should be implemented.
2. Do general clean-up and finish writing the README.
3. Check different STL viewers to see how they orient their coordinate systems.
