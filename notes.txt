notes:
It seems as though adding multithreading did not significantly help export time. Perhaps batch processing with the GPU could help.

todo:
write code to prevent adding points from sub-boxes that are part of another patch face (i.e., leave holes in large patch faces and then handle sub patch faces)
write code to connect stranded patch face edge point to nearest patch face edge point on other another edge
